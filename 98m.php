It is best&nbsp;to have someone get your split time at 100 meters and call it out to you immediately (whole seconds are not exact enough, get it to the nearest tenth.)  <div>Also make sure to get regular interval splits recorded&nbsp;for the rest of your race (four&nbsp;to eight should be enough.)</div>
