You remember&nbsp;that harmless little "pop" off the starting line?<div>It was a short, quick little sprint that put you through the first 100 meters in, let's say, 16.2 seconds.</div><div>Your "settled in" pace brought you through the 200 meters at 34 seconds,&nbsp;so you ran that second 100 in 17.8 seconds.</div><div>At 200 meters, you think your current pace is&nbsp;34 seconds per lap. &nbsp;It is actually 35.6 (2 X 17.8.)</div>
