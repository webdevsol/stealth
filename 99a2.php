Oh, by the way, if you want the loudest reaction from&nbsp;a crowd, nothing beats&nbsp;even-splitting an open 400 meter race&nbsp;on an indoor track against runners who are no&nbsp;better than you.<div>Passing runners who, near the end of the race,&nbsp;are going much&nbsp;slower and have no energy&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;problem even on&nbsp;a sharp turn.</div><div>You will go from distant last to first so fast, spectators&nbsp;will HAVE to react because they've&nbsp;probably never seen it before.</div>
