Don't do the 100 meter split routine more than once unless you really screw it up the first time.<div>It can be difficult to race and think at the same time(the longer the race the more it becomes&nbsp;appropriate.)</div><div>In shorter races, if&nbsp;your thoughts can't take the form of&nbsp;pictures in your mind, or can't be expressed in short phrases, it can&nbsp;be tough to get the level of relaxation you need.</div>
